# Today I Learned

A collection of snippets of useful information.

Based on [Simon Willison's TIL collection](https://github.com/simonw/til), which he describes [here](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/).

In the spirit of not over-engineering things, I'm starting with a basic github repository (this one!) containing snippets.
The basic structure is a series of directories, each of which is a "topic", such as `python`, or `powershell`.
In each directory will be a set of files (mostly Markdown, but I may try other formats as I go along), that are the articles themselves.

That's it for now.

## Plans

Collecting the information is all I want in the first instance. I can worry about presentation later. But I *will* worry about presentation :slightly_smiling_face:

I'll probably end up building a "proper" website that uses this data. Maybe with Nikola - I like that, and it seems like a good fit.
But no over-engineering! Start with the information, and work from there.
